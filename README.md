# Portals for Office 365

This project was created to make using multiple accounts with Office 365 easier. There is more details of on how the application works on my website [MyTeamsLab](https://www.myteamslab.com). There is also a video on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/fNosmBF-fzg) that you can check out. 

Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/jamescussen/PortalsReleases/releases) page to download the installer (PortalsInstall-win32-x64.exe).

## Change Log

Version 1.01: 
  - Added the ability to zoom in and out on web pages in the browser window using the menu and hotkeys.
  
Version 1.02:

  - Changed new window link clicking behavior. If you click on a link that requests a new window or tab it will get opened in a new window. This makes Exchange Admin Centre's window popping addiction workable.
  - Added "Open link in this window" option to right click in browser.
